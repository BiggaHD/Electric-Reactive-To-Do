> #### Electron-React-To-Do-App :) 
> ###### Intro: Example of simple Electron-React application written in TypeSctript.

> This is my very first take on `Electron`. Since I'm usually using `React`, I combined them into one.
> YES, of course, it's a To-Do app. But it has some nice features and it's still in development, but fully functional.
> It's also important to note that it saves your data. I did it for fun, to get to know `Electron` and to refresh my `TypeScript` skills.

> #### Installation: 
> `npm i` - This will install all of the necessary dependencies.

> #### Usage
> `npm run dev` - This will start all the needed scripts for you to explore it further :)
